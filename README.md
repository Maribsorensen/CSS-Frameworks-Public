# Blikk (CSS Frameworks Course Assignment)

![image]()

This project was created as a built on JavaScript course 2 project. It was originally code created by a teacher at Noroff, then edited with testing and more javascript by me in the Javascript 2 course. Lastly it was used in the CSS Frameworks course assignment where I was tasked to style the full website with Tailwind.
